                The circular plots link the “primary regions of diversity” of crops (regions where crops were initially domesticated and
                evolved over long periods of time, and where the diversity of traditional crop varieties and related wild
                plants is especially high) with crops’ current importance in regional <a href="/#/interdependence/food_supplies/1">food supplies</a>,
                measured in terms of calories (kcal/capita/day), protein (g/capita/day), fat (g/capita/day), and food weight
                (g/capita/day), and in regional agricultural <a href="/#/interdependence/production/0">production</a>,
                measured in terms of total production quantity (tonnes), harvested area (ha), and gross production value
                (million US$)].

            <br />
            <p class="text-justify">
                Each region has a color representing its own “native” crops and those colors are connected to other regions due the importance
                of those crops in the diets/agricultural production in other regions. The direction of the contribution is
                indicated by both the “native” region’s color and a gap between the connecting line and the consuming/producing
                region’s segment. The magnitude of contribution is indicated by the width of the connecting line. Because
                the line width is nonlinearly adapted to the curvature, it corresponds to the contribution size only at the
                start and end points. Regional food supply values (per capita/day) were formed by deriving a weighted average
                of national food supply values across countries comprising each region, with national values weighted by
                population. Regional production values were formed by summing national production values across countries
                comprising each region.

            <h2>About the data</h2>
            <p class="text-justify">
                We analyzed the full set of food crop commodities included in national food supply and pertinent national production data
                provided by <a href="http://faostat3.fao.org/home/E">FAO</a> (1) [for food supplies- calories
                (kcal/capita/day), protein (g/capita/day), fat (g/capita/day), and food weight (g/capita/day); for production
                systems- production quantity (tonnes), harvested area (ha), and gross production value (current million US$)].
                National food supply from plants represents national production plus imports plus or minus stock changes
                over the survey period; minus exports, quantities used for seed, animal feed, and in the manufacture of non-food
                products, and losses during storage and transport. While food supplies data accounts for direct human consumption,
                production data for crops such as maize and soybean is potentially inclusive of livestock and industrial
                uses as well as human food. In the production analysis we also included agricultural crops indirectly contributing
                to human food supplies via livestock production (i.e., alfalfa, clover, and vetch). Non-food (e.g., industrial
                and fibre) crops as well as animal product commodities were not included in the analysis. Plant commodities
                comprised of the same crop species were aggregated into single commodities representing the crop, e.g., sesame
                seed oil and sesame seed. After aggregation, 53 crop commodities remained in food supplies data, and 132
                crop commodities in production data.

            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="text-justify">
                We analyzed data for each crop commodity per country per measurement over the most recent three years for which sufficient
                data were available (2009-2011). All (177) countries consistently reported during the time period were included
                for food supplies variables, as well as for production quantity and harvested area, covering 98.5% of the
                world’s population. All (141) countries reported for (current million US$) production value were included,
                covering 94.1% of the world’s population.

            <br />

                Primary regions of diversity were assigned based upon primary and secondary literature regarding centres of crop diversity,
                origins of crop domestication, and high species richness of closely related wild plants (2-17). Regional classifications
                followed those listed in Annex 2 of the FAO State of the World’s Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (18),
                modified to more accurately represent eco-geographic parameters driving plant species distributions. Specifically,
                both western and eastern Europe were split into north and south regions to account for temperate versus Mediterranean
                ecologies; Australia and New Zealand were segregated from remaining (tropical) islands of the Pacific region;
                and South America was split into Andean, temperate, and tropical regions. A total of 23 eco-geographic regions
                were delineated worldwide. In order to account for eco-geographic variation within countries, countries whose
                boundaries included more than one eco-geographic region were included in all appropriate regions (e.g., Colombia
                was assigned both to Andean and to tropical South American regions). See the <a href="/data/metadata/Countries_regions_table_2016_2_11.xlsx"
                target="_blank">countries-regions table</a> for a listing of all countries and their eco-geographic regions.

            <p class="text-justify">
                To be generally inclusive in regard to regions of diversity of crops, crops whose primary areas of diversity encompassed
                more than one eco-geographic region were listed in all appropriate regions (e.g., wheat was listed in Central
                Asia, West Asia, and the South and East Mediterranean due to the high diversity of traditional crop varieties
                and wild relatives in each of these regions). Forty-two of the 53 crop commodities treated in food supplies
                data, and 116 of the 132 crops in production data, were attributable to primary regions of diversity, with
                the remaining general commodities which were not clearly attributable to specific crop species listed as
                “not specified”. These not specified commodities included (for food supplies) - beverages, alcoholic; beverages,
                fermented; cereals, other; citrus, other; fruits, other; miscellaneous; oilcrops, other; spices, other; sweeteners,
                other; treenuts; and vegetables, other. For production systems - berries nes, cereals nes, fruit citrus nes,
                fruit fresh nes, fruit pome nes, fruit stone nes, fruit tropical fresh nes, grain mixed, nuts nes, oilseeds
                nes, pulses nes, roots tubers nes, spices nes, tea nes, vegetables fresh nes, and vegetables leguminous nes.

            <p class="text-justify">
                For each country, we determined the importance of each primary region of diversity around the world to its national food
                supply and national production by summing the contribution of consumed/produced crops by their primary regions
                of diversity. <a href="/data/metadata/Dietsandproduction_regioncrops_to_country_matrix_2016_2_11.xlsx"
