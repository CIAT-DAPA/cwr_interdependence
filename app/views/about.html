    <h2>About the plot</h2>
    <p class="text-justify">
        The circular plots link the “primary regions of diversity” of crops (regions where crops were initially domesticated and
        evolved over long periods of time, and where the diversity of traditional crop varieties and related wild plants
        is especially high) with crops’ current importance in regional <a href="/#/interdependence/fs_interdependence_complex_text/2">food supplies</a>,
        measured in terms of calories (kcal/capita/day), protein (g/capita/day), fat (g/capita/day), and food weight (g/capita/day),
        and in regional agricultural <a href="/#/interdependence/prod_interdependence_complex_text/0">production</a>, measured
        in terms of total production quantity (tonnes), harvested area (ha), and gross production value (million US$)].
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="text-justify">
        Each region has a color representing its own “native” crops and those colors are connected to other regions due the importance
        of those crops in the diets/agricultural production in other regions. The direction of the contribution is indicated
        by both the “native” region’s color and a gap between the connecting line and the consuming/producing region’s segment.
        The magnitude of contribution is indicated by the width of the connecting line. Because the line width is nonlinearly
        adapted to the curvature, it corresponds to the contribution size only at the start and end points. Regional food
        supply values (per capita/day) were formed by deriving a weighted average of national food supply values across countries
        comprising each region, with national values weighted by population. Regional production values were formed by summing
        national production values across countries comprising each region.

    <h2>About the data</h2>
    <p class="text-justify">
        We analyzed the full set of food crop commodities included in national food supply and pertinent national production data
        provided by <a href="http://faostat3.fao.org/home/E">FAO</a>1 [for food supplies- calories (kcal/capita/day),
        protein (g/capita/day), fat (g/capita/day), and food weight (g/capita/day); for production systems- production quantity
        (tonnes), harvested area (ha), and gross production value (current million US$)]. National food supply from plants
        represents national production plus imports plus or minus stock changes over the survey period; minus exports, quantities
        used for seed, animal feed, and in the manufacture of non-food products, and losses during storage and transport.
        While food supplies data accounts for direct human consumption, production data for crops such as maize and soybean
        is potentially inclusive of livestock and industrial uses as well as human food. In the production analysis we also
        included agricultural crops indirectly contributing to human food supplies via livestock production (i.e., alfalfa,
        clover, and vetch). Non-food (e.g., industrial and fibre) crops as well as animal product commodities were not included
        in the analysis. Plant commodities comprised of the same crop species were aggregated into single commodities representing
        the crop, e.g., sesame seed oil and sesame seed. After aggregation, 53 crop commodities remained in <a href="/data/metadata/Foodsupplies_regioncrops_to_country_matrix_2016_2_11.xlsx"
        target="_blank">food supplies data</a>, and 132 crop commodities in <a href="/data/metadata/Production_regioncrops_to_country_matrix_2016_2_11.xlsx"
        target="_blank">production data</a>.

    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="text-justify">
        We analyzed data for each crop commodity per country per measurement over the most recent three years for which sufficient
        data were available (2009-2011). All (177) countries consistently reported during the time period were included for
        food supplies variables, as well as for production quantity and harvested area, covering 98.5% of the world’s population.
        All (141) countries reported for (current million US$) production value were included, covering 94.1% of the world’s
        population.

    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="text-justify">
        Primary regions of diversity were assigned based upon primary and secondary literature regarding centres of crop diversity,
        origins of crop domestication, and high species richness of closely related wild plants2-11. Regional classifications
        followed those listed in Annex 2 of the FAO State of the World’s Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture12,
        modified to more accurately represent eco-geographic parameters driving plant species distributions. Specifically,
        both western and eastern Europe were split into north and south regions to account for temperate versus Mediterranean
        ecologies; Australia and New Zealand were segregated from remaining (tropical) islands of the Pacific region; and
        South America was split into Andean, temperate, and tropical regions. A total of 23 eco-geographic regions were delineated
        worldwide. In order to account for eco-geographic variation within countries, countries whose boundaries included
        more than one eco-geographic region were included in all appropriate regions (e.g., Colombia was assigned both to
        Andean and to tropical South American regions). See the <a href="/data/metadata/Countries_regions_table_2016_2_11.xlsx"
        target="_blank">countries-regions table</a> for a listing of all countries and their eco-geographic regions.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="text-justify">
        To be generally inclusive in regard to regions of diversity of crops, crops whose primary areas of diversity encompassed
        more than one eco-geographic region were listed in all appropriate regions (e.g., wheat was listed in Central Asia,
        West Asia, and the South and East Mediterranean due to the high diversity of traditional crop varieties and wild
        relatives in each of these regions). Forty-two of the 53 crop commodities treated in food supplies data, and 116
        of the 132 crops in production data, were attributable to primary regions of diversity, with the remaining general
        commodities which were not clearly attributable to specific crop species listed as “not specified”. These not specified
        commodities included (for food supplies) - beverages, alcoholic; beverages, fermented; cereals, other; citrus, other;
        fruits, other; miscellaneous; oilcrops, other; spices, other; sweeteners, other; treenuts; and vegetables, other.
        For production systems - berries nes, cereals nes, fruit citrus nes, fruit fresh nes, fruit pome nes, fruit stone
        nes, fruit tropical fresh nes, grain mixed, nuts nes, oilseeds nes, pulses nes, roots tubers nes, spices nes, tea
        nes, vegetables fresh nes, and vegetables leguminous nes. See the crops-regions table for a listing of all crops
        and their primary regions of diversity. The <a href="/#/map">crop map</a> displays primary regions of diversity
        for selected major agricultural crops (81 crops shown).
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="text-justify">
        For each country, we determined the importance of each primary region of diversity around the world to its national food
        supply and national production by summing the contribution of consumed/produced crops by their primary regions of
        diversity. <a href="/data/metadata/Dietsandproduction_regioncrops_to_country_matrix_2016_2_11.xlsx" target="_blank">Country level information</a>        on the importance of primary regions of diversity is available for download for both national food supplies and national
        production systems. The circular plots display this data, with consuming/producing countries aggregated to the regional
        level.
