# Where our food crops come from #

This repository contains the code and tools needed to generate and visualize information on the relevance of 'primary regions of diversity' of food crops to modern food supplies and agricultural production. The circos diagrams are coded in R, from which .json files are created for use online. The methods and [code](https://github.com/null2/globalmigration) for the plots were derived from [The Global Flow of People](http://www.global-migration.info/) by Nikola Sander, Guy J. Abel and Ramon Bauer at the Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital. 

The finished interactive product online is available at http://blog.ciat.cgiar.org/origin-of-crops/. This work is by Colin K. Khoury, Harold A.
